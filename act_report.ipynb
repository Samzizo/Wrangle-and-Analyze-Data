    "> [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media attention both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter for breaking these aforementioned laws.\n",
    "Nelson, a golf management major at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina, was inspired by Weird Twitter and had amassed a 10,000-person following on his personal Twitter account.\n",
    "In 2015, he and a friend were at an Applebee's, when he set up a Twitter poll from his personal account asking if he should create a dog rating account; the positive response led him to create the account, which combines cute animals with irreverent snark.\n",
    "WeRateDogs asks people to send photos of their dogs, then tweets selected photos rating and a humorous comment. Dogs are rated on a scale of one to ten, but are invariably given ratings in excess of the maximum, such as \"13/10\". Popular posts are re-posted on Instagram and Facebook.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017"
